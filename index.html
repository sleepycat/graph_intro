## Relational data

???
Programmers are trained to be able bash data of any shape into the shape of a table.
What shape was the data before the golden hammer was weilded? Probably a graph.
Have we lost anything by bashing it into this new shape?

This is a really interesting quote from Microsoft Technical Fellow Dharma Shukla.

Isn't that a dependency graph? Shouldn't we explicitly model the relationships?

# Our test hierarchy: e-commerce categories
.eighty[![categories](images/categories.png)]

---
class: center, middle

# A popular strategy: the nested sets pattern
.eighty[![numbered](images/nested_numbered.png)]

???
Here is the planning phase, where you decide what numbers the categories are
going to have relative to each other.
---
class: middle

## Nested sets
```sql
# The structure
CREATE TABLE nested_category (
	category_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
	name VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
	lft INT NOT NULL,
	rgt INT NOT NULL
);

# The data
INSERT INTO nested_category VALUES(1,'ELECTRONICS',1,20),(2,'TELEVISIONS',2,9),(3,'TUBE',3,4),
 (4,'LCD',5,6),(5,'PLASMA',7,8),(6,'PORTABLE ELECTRONICS',10,19),(7,'MP3 PLAYERS',11,14),(8,'FLASH',12,13),
 (9,'CD PLAYERS',15,16),(10,'2 WAY RADIOS',17,18);
```
???
Then a table structure is created and finally the categories and the numbers
which denote their level of nesting
---
class: middle

# Graph data

```sh
db._createDocumentCollection('categories') // A container for our vertices
// our vertex data:
[
  {
    "_key" : "electronics",
    "_id" : "categories/electronics",
    "_rev" : "_VHhY1zy---",
    "name" : "electronics"
  },
  {
    "_key" : "televisions",
    "_id" : "categories/televisions",
    "_rev" : "_VHhZQkq---",
    "name" : "televisions"
  },
...
]

db._createEdgeCollection('relations') // A container for our edges
// our edge data:
[
  {
    "_key" : "1318642540530",
    "_id" : "relations/1318642540530",
    "_from" : "categories/televisions",
    "_to" : "categories/electronics",
    "_rev" : "_VHhcJMS---"
  },
...
]
```
???
A graph would simply have a collection of categories. Relations are not
calculated on the fly, they are saved as data as well: another collection
containing edges

# Differences so far

## Relational
* Data stored as rows in tables
* All columns must be known in advance
* Relationships are calculated

## Graph
* Data stored as "documents" in collections
* Collections don't care about the "shape" of a document*
* Relationships are also documents

# Differences pt 2

* Change is easier for systems built like this
* Certain ideas naturally expressed as graphs: simpler code/no "sql design patterns"
* Less upfront planning
* Scaling == more machines
* Plus another thing...

Queries are an interesting point of comparison but the real value is in being
able to change systems so they evolve with your needs.

# Our graph data

.ninetyfive[![plus game consoles](images/graph_hierarchy.png)]

We decided to model our data as a graph instead of a table so our system is easier to change and deals with complicated data without accreting complexity. This choice leaves us with an interesting byproduct: a graph structure.
